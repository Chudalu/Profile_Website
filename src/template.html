                I studied to earn a bachelors degree in Computer Engineering from <a href="https://site.gtuc.edu.gh/" target="_blank"> Ghana Technology University College</a> (2012-2016). I furthered my studies by earning a Masters degree in Artificial Intelligence from <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank">The University of Edinburgh</a> (2017-2018). I observed a 1-year <a href="https://www.nysc.gov.ng/" target="_blank">National Youth Service</a> in my country, which ended in May 2020. I was assigned to work with <a href="https://celteckwireless.com/" target="_blank">Celteck Wireless Limited</a>. They are a renown internet service provider in Enugu state, Nigeria.

                My research interests include: Swarm Intelligence, Swarm robotics, Multi-agent robots, Internet of Things and Bio-inspired robotics. My research goal is to develop technologies that would enable the successful implementation of swarm robots in diverse applications. Swarm robots are expected to be resilient and reliable in the face of uncertainties and intrusion, just like natural swarms. I research on this by looking at hybridizing or combining the base behaviour of a swarm robot with other behaviours that can complement or supplement it. This provides redundancies or alternatives in the system when faced with challenges.

                <div>
                  <p class="mb-4">
                    This research confidently showed that when a hybrid of swarm behaviours are used to control swarm robots in order to undertake a given task successfully, it would perform much better in terms of work-done, speed, optimality and consistency than swarm robots controlled with a specific swarm behaviour. This is true given that the behaviours used to hybridize are complementary or supplementary to each other, which can facilitate redundancy in the system and resilience against uncertainties. To further validate this hypothesis a research into the collective behaviour in hybrid stigmergic swarms would be conducted by not only relying on simulations, which was the main source of results in this work, but also relying heavily on hardware robotic implementations and deployment. This can be either mobile swarm robots or swarm UAVs. There are many models and behaviours that can be used to hybridize the base swarm behaviour of a robot system. I have hypothesized that the behaviour to hybridize with are highly dependent on the nature of the tasks to be achieved. Therefore intricate look into how improvements can be made to precise specifications like speed, optimality, redundancy, robustness, agility etc. might need certain types of hybridizations. This would allow us to create swarm robots that are capable of working in harsh and unpredictable environments.

                <div>
                  <p class="mb-4">
                    In this project an indoor localization system was developed using Bluetooth beacons, a microncontroller, an IMU, an android phone and a custom cloud system. A step counter, heading estimator and a beacon scanner was developed and they resided in the microcontroller. An android application that connects with the micro-controller over Bluetooth and received packets containing data from the processes there was developed. The application hosted a position estimation algorithm that utilized a particle filter. The estimated position was finally sent over http to the cloud, where it was visualized and stored in a database.

                    In this project a step counter was developed with the aid of a microcontroller, IMU - accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and an android phone. The step tracker is an android application that hosted an algorithm which received real time inputs from the microcontroller over Bluetooth connection, to determine when a step was taken and to keep a record of how many were taken. The microcontroller was programmed in mbed online compiler using C++, and it was connected to the sensors (IMU - accelerometer etc.) to receive the sensor inputs and transfer to the android application for processing.

                    In this thesis projet a home automation control  unit was developed. It was designed to control appliances like – air-conditioners, light bulbs and other plug-in appliances based on sensor inputs from – PIR , light and temperature sensors. This utilised a microcontroller and various circuits that facilitated these controls.
